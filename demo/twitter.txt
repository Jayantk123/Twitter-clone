Twitter is a social networking platform where people can express their thoughts in short posts which people can read and share
n this tutorial, weâ€™re going to create a small Twitter-like mobile app using React Native. With our app, users will be able to create accounts and log in, see a feed of all of the posts created by themselves and other users, and add their own posts to the feed. The data for all of our users and posts will be managed by Cosmic JS.
